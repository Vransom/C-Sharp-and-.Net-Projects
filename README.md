# C-Sharp-and-.Net-Projects

These are some small projects I made using C# and .NET Framework

<h1>Projects</h1>
  <p><ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/Vransom/C-Sharp-and-.Net-Projects/tree/main/CarInsurance">Car Insurance</a></li>

  </ul></p>

<h2>Car Insurance</h2>
<p> This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. Users can enter their information to get a monthly quote based on their driving history, car info, and age. Admin at the car insurance company are also able to view the quotes and custmer inputs on a seperate page.</p>

<h2>Twenty-One</h2>
<p>Welcome to Vegas! This is a game based on BlackJack where the user can enter their name, amount they brought to play with, and amount they'd like to bet. They can choose whether to hit or stay, but it's up to the cards (or computer in this case) to decide their fate.</p>

<h3>Code-First</h3>
<p>This was another project I worked on that uses the Code-First methodology to create a database of students.</p>

<h3>Other</h3>
<p>There are many other drills located in this repository, however the three above are the ones that I am most proud of. Can't wait to learn more!</p>
